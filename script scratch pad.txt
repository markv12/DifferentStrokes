Hey! You made it!
Let's talk!

<size=150%><anim:wave>Welcome to my exhibition!</anim></size><p:normal>
I'm so glad you came! <p:tiny>I've been working for <i>such</i> a long time to put this together. 

This is my <p:tiny>super-<p:tiny>spectacular <p:tiny><b><anim:wave>collaboratorium</anim>!</b>
<p:normal><size=85%>It's a social experiment to see how complete strangers can come together <p:tiny>through the magic of art!</size>

Visitors can paint their own masterpiece, <p:tiny>and then have it finished off by another visitor! <p:tiny>Great, <p:tiny>huh?

<size=70%>But... <p:normal>You probably think I'm naive, <p:tiny>don't you?</size>

Look, I know that people are <i>probably</i> going to try to troll my exhibition. 
<p:short>But I'm not worried!

Why do you think I invited <b>you,</b> <p:tiny>my <anim:wave>oldest, dearest friend?</anim> I'm counting on you to help me keep things <color=#00F236>clean and beautiful</color>! Here, take this paintbrush.

Please do your best to help me <b>
<color=#FF6539>fix the bad pieces, <p:short>
<color=#00F236>vote to keep the good ones, <p:short>
<color=#000000>and <color=#00B5EE>paint new pictures</b> for the exhibition!




Welcome to the exhibition!
I'll be your guide.

Thanks for visiting!
<p:tiny>Here's how the exhibition works.

Browse through the gallery at your leisure. <p:tiny>Every painting you see has been made by another visitor!

<size=120%>Blank canvases</size> are open for you to paint! <p:tiny>Please don't hesitate to add your own piece to the exhibition.

<size=120%>Roped-off paintings</size> are part of our <anim:wave><i>Permanent Collection</i></anim>, and can no longer be painted over. <p:tiny>Please do take the time to <color=#00F236>rate</color> the pieces you like, <p:tiny>or the ones you dislike!

<size=120%>Everything else</size> can be painted over! <p:tiny>If you see something you'd like to add to, <p:tiny>or fix, <p:tiny>or redo, feel free to get creative!

<size=90%>Once a painting has been painted over once, it goes in the <i>permanent collection</i>. <p:tiny>From there, visitors can vote to keep it in the collection, but the painting itself can <anim:shake><color=#FF6539>never be changed again...</color></anim></size>

No pressure, <p:tiny>though ;)
<p:normal>Have fun!

<size=50%>Oh, <p:normal>and, uh...</size>
<p:normal>Don't be scared of Wallace, the guard. <p:tiny>I know he's got a <anim:shake><color=#FF6539>mean glare</color></anim>, but he won't judge you for what you paint.
<p:normal><size=50%>He sure freaks me out, though...</size>



Howdy.

This is a real' lonely
job, compadre.

Don't tell anyone, but I
really liked yer last painting.

D'you think the receptionist
would go fer a fella like me?

People tell me I get to
starin' a bit too much.

I wish I could talk to that
receptionist over yonder...

D'you know the receptionist's name?

Couldja give the receptionist
a message for me? ...Aw, shucks,
forget I asked.

Say, don't I know you?
Are you an artist here?

Evenin' pardner!











Ugh, how derivative!

Not my taste,
no, not at all.

Oy.

No me gusta.

How could they show
something like this??

Yuck.

Eww, really?

Seriously?

I have half a mind to fix
this one... permanently.

(chuckles softly)

Oof.

Uneven. Churlish.

Amateurish!

Gah!

Jiminy Cricket!

Boo.

Booooooooo.

This is SO 2020s...

Only a zoomer would paint this.

Only a millenial would paint this.

Only a boomer would paint this.

I didn't pay 15 ghost
bucks to see this...

Ugh, childish.

(laughs aloud)

(snorts)

(looks away sheepishly)

(blushes)

When I close my eyes,
I still see it...

Interesting use of color.

Interesting shapes.

Yes, a dynamic approach, yes.

The chiaroscuro!
The drama!

Ah, notes of the struggle
between good and evil.

The textural elements
are really working here.

Can you feel it?
Can you?

Do you get what they
were going for here?

Have you worked with
this artist before?

I've been following
this artist for years.

They call me the
'in-spectre'... get it?

What do you think, honey
-- wait, who are you?

How much would
you pay for this?

I'm thinking of buying
the coffee mug of this.

Spooky.

Don't you think
it looks like me?

Wow, this looks
just like you!

Did you paint this?

A return to nature...

How pastoral.

Lovely asymmetry
in this piece.

The use of motif
is glorious.

Note the stippling
in the sublayer.

I'm just here for
the snacks, honestly.

Wait, there are
no free snacks???

Are you friends
with the artist?

I think that guard
is watching me...

That guard keeps
giving me weird looks.

Is it just me, or is
that guard kinda cute?

Hi, are you...
here alone?

Everyone always looks
cute at an exhibition.

I came here to
see this one!

My friend did this one!

I read about this
one in the paper.

The 6 o'clock news
had a story about this.

I see these three as a triptych.

I've heard this artist
is famous in France.

They recently did a show
in London.

How bold!

Very dreamy.

I wanna buy this one!

Reminiscent of Pollock, no?

Reminiscent of Manet.

Reminiscent of myself
in my youth.

Reminds me of Monet's
early period.

Reminds me of a piece
by van Gogh.

Reminds me of Bosch's
dreamscapes.

Teamwork makes the
dream work, eh?

I love their use of light.

What fine brushwork!

The flowing lines,
the subtle motion...

Quite good, quite good.

Yes. Yes.

Now that's fine!

I appreciate the
artist's restraint.

I'm a sucker for subtle depth.

Ooh, how organic.

Curvaceous!

Looks delicious!

Oh, delectable!

How tantalizing!

The gentle motion...

I wonder if this
is life-size...

How huge! How grand!

I want to reach out
and touch it!

So realistic,
I can almost feel it.

Is... is that what
I think it is?

Phew, this is the
real deal.

Would you like to
be friends?

I thought paintings were
supposed to make you happy?

Hi! What's your name?

I've been here for
four days now.

Do you remember
the way back?

Pffffff â€” can you believe
they really did that?

Wow, a diamond
in the rough!

Finally, art that even
I can get behind.

This is art for the
people, by the people.

Wow, this really speaks to me.

I'm lost...

Have you met my partner?

Would you look at that...

Well, nothing's gonna
top this...

Cripes!

Ooh la la~












I think my partner has a
crush on his coworker.

Greetings!

Salutations to you!

I'm a painter too, you know.

One of the paintings
in this room is mine!

I mostly paint nudes,
personally.

How about you take a break?

(snoring)

My arms are connected in a
U-shape behind my back.

I think I look better in these
pants than my coworkers.






Yes, some <anim:shake>jokers</anim> have been drawing, <p:short>er, <p:short><i>less than ideal</i> art in my exhibition. 

The truth is, <p:short>and I'm only telling you this because we're friends, but... <p:short>I've got a <color=#FF6539>problem</color>.
