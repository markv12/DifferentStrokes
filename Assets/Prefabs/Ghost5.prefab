  speechBubbleText: 'Ugh, how derivative!


    Not my taste,

    no, not at all.


    Oy.


    No
    me gusta.


    How could they show

    something like this??


    Yuck.


    Eww,
    really?


    Seriously?


    I have half a mind to fix

    this one... permanently.


    (chuckles
    softly)


    Oof.


    Uneven. Churlish.


    Amateurish!


    Gah!


    Jiminy
    Cricket!


    Boo.


    Booooooooo.


    This is SO 2020s...


    Only a
    zoomer would paint this.


    Only a millenial would paint this.


    Only
    a boomer would paint this.


    I didn''t pay 15 ghost

    bucks to see this...


    Ugh,
    childish.


    (laughs aloud)


    (snorts)


    (looks away sheepishly)


    (blushes)


    When
    I close my eyes,

    I still see it...


    Interesting use of color.


    Interesting
    shapes.


    Yes, a dynamic approach, yes.


    The chiaroscuro!

    The drama!


    Ah,
    notes of the struggle

    between good and evil.


    The textural elements

    are
    really working here.


    Can you feel it?

    Can you?


    Do you get what
    they

    were going for here?


    Have you worked with

    this artist before?


    I''ve
    been following

    this artist for years.


    They call me the

    ''in-spectre''...
    get it?


    What do you think, honey

    -- wait, who are you?


    How much
    would

    you pay for this?


    I''m thinking of buying

    the coffee mug
    of this.


    Spooky.


    Don''t you think

    it looks like me?


    Wow,
    this looks

    just like you!


    Did you paint this?


    A return to nature...


    How
    pastoral.


    Lovely asymmetry

    in this piece.


    The use of motif

    is
    glorious.


    Note the stippling

    in the sublayer.


    I''m just here
    for

    the snacks, honestly.


    Wait, there are

    no free snacks???


    Are
    you friends

    with the artist?


    I think that guard

    is watching me...


    That
    guard keeps

    giving me weird looks.


    Is it just me, or is

    that
    guard kinda cute?


    Hi, are you...

    here alone?


    Everyone always
    looks

    cute at an exhibition.


    I came here to

    see this one!


    My
    friend did this one!


    I read about this

    one in the paper.


    The
    6 o''clock news

    had a story about this.


    I see these three as a triptych.


    I''ve
    heard this artist

    is famous in France.


    They recently did a show

    in
    London.


    How bold!


    Very dreamy.


    I wanna buy this one!


    Reminiscent
    of Pollock, no?


    Reminiscent of Manet.


    Reminiscent of myself

    in
    my youth.


    Reminds me of Monet''s

    early period.


    Reminds me of
    a piece

    by van Gogh.


    Reminds me of Bosch''s

    dreamscapes.


    Teamwork
    makes the

    dream work, eh?


    I love their use of light.


    What fine
    brushwork!


    The flowing lines,

    the subtle motion...


    Quite good,
    quite good.


    Yes. Yes.


    Now that''s fine!


    I appreciate the

    artist''s
    restraint.


    I''m a sucker for subtle depth.


    Ooh, how organic.


    Curvaceous!


    Looks
    delicious!


    Oh, delectable!


    How tantalizing!


    The gentle motion...


    I
    wonder if this

    is life-size...


    How huge! How grand!


    I want to
    reach out

    and touch it!


    So realistic,

    I can almost feel it.'
