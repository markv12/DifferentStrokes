    me gusta.\n\nHow could they show\nsomething like this??\n\nYuck.\n\nEww, really?\n\nSeriously?\n\nI
    have half a mind to fix\nthis one... permanently.\n\n(chuckles softly)\n\nOof.\n\nUneven.
    Churlish.\n\nAmateurish!\n\nGah!\n\nJiminy Cricket!\n\nBoo.\n\nBooooooooo.\n\nThis
    is SO 2020s...\n\nOnly a zoomer would paint this.\n\nOnly a millennial would
    paint this.\n\nOnly a boomer would paint this.\n\nI didn't pay 15 ghost\nbucks
    to see this...\n\nUgh, childish.\n\n(laughs aloud)\n\n(snorts)\n\n(looks away
    sheepishly)\n\n(blushes)\n\nWhen I close my eyes,\nI still see it...\n\nInteresting
    use of color.\n\nInteresting shapes.\n\nYes, a dynamic approach, yes.\n\nThe
    chiaroscuro!\nThe drama!\n\nAh, notes of the struggle\nbetween good and evil.\n\nThe
    textural elements\nare really working here.\n\nCan you feel it?\nCan you?\n\nDo
    you get what they\nwere going for here?\n\nHave you worked with\nthis artist
    before?\n\nI've been following\nthis artist for years.\n\nThey call me the\n'in-spectre'...
    get it?\n\nWhat do you think, honey\n-- wait, who are you?\n\nHow much would\nyou
    pay for this?\n\nI'm thinking of buying\nthe coffee mug of this.\n\nSpooky.\n\nDon't
    you think\nit looks like me?\n\nWow, this looks\njust like you!\n\nDid you paint
    this?\n\nA return to nature...\n\nHow pastoral.\n\nLovely asymmetry\nin this
    piece.\n\nThe use of motif\nis glorious.\n\nNote the stippling\nin the sublayer.\n\nI'm
    just here for\nthe snacks, honestly.\n\nWait, there are\nno free snacks???\n\nAre
    you friends\nwith the artist?\n\nI think that guard\nis watching me...\n\nThat
    guard keeps\ngiving me weird looks.\n\nIs it just me, or is\nthat guard kinda
    cute?\n\nHi, are you...\nhere alone?\n\nEveryone always looks\ncute at an exhibition.\n\nI
    came here to\nsee this one!\n\nMy friend did this one!\n\nI read about this\none
    in the paper.\n\nThe 6 o'clock news\nhad a story about this.\n\nI see these three
    as a triptych.\n\nI've heard this artist\nis famous in France.\n\nThey recently
    did a show\nin London.\n\nHow bold!\n\nVery dreamy.\n\nI wanna buy this one!\n\nReminiscent
    of Pollock, no?\n\nReminiscent of Manet.\n\nReminiscent of myself\nin my youth.\n\nReminds
    me of Monet's\nearly period.\n\nReminds me of a piece\nby van Gogh.\n\nReminds
    me of Bosch's\ndreamscapes.\n\nTeamwork makes the\ndream work, eh?\n\nI love
    their use of light.\n\nWhat fine brushwork!\n\nThe flowing lines,\nthe subtle
    motion...\n\nQuite good, quite good.\n\nYes. Yes.\n\nNow that's fine!\n\nI appreciate
    the\nartist's restraint.\n\nI'm a sucker for subtle depth.\n\nOoh, how organic.\n\nCurvaceous!\n\nLooks
    delicious!\n\nOh, delectable!\n\nHow tantalizing!\n\nThe gentle motion...\n\nI
